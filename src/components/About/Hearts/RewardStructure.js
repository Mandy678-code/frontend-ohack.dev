      <StyledTypography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The detailed heart reward structure serves as a guideline to recognize and incentivize valuable contributions in the things we build to support the world. It's designed to provide clear objectives and motivate continuous improvement. However, it's important to note that these criteria are not rigid rules, but flexible guidelines.
        </StyledTypography>
        <StyledTypography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Opportunity Hack retains discretion in awarding hearts, considering the unique aspects of each contribution. This approach, inspired by insights from decision-making research, allows for nuanced evaluation that accounts for context, creativity, and unexpected positive outcomes. It helps mitigate biases and 'noise' in decision-making while maintaining a fair and motivating system.
        </StyledTypography>
        <StyledTypography variant="body1">
        Remember, the heart system aims to encourage growth, collaboration, and impactful contributions. Focus on the spirit of these guidelines rather than treating them as a checklist. Your unique efforts and their real-world impact are what truly matter.
